  <p align="center">
  <i>A desktop app made using Tkinter and Pygame modules of Python to visualize different computer algorithms like searching, sorting and backtracking e.t.c.
  The main motive of this project is to help out beginners who's trying to understand the basic idea of common algorithms. 
  More algorithms and sounds will be added to improve the overall experience of the users and make it more user friendly.</i>
